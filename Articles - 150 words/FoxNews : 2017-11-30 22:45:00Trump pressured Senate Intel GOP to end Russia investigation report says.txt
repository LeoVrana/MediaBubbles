President Trump exhorted Senate Republican leaders, including the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, to bring its investigation into Russian activities during last year's election to a swift conclusion, The New York Times reported late Thursday. Sen Richard Burr, R-N.C., told the paper that Trump told him "something along the lines of, 'I hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible.'" Burr said he told the president that "when we have exhausted everybody we need to talk to, we will finish." The Times report, which cited half a dozen lawmakers and aides, claimed that Trump had complained to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that he was not doing enough to bring the investigation to an end. Sen Roy Blunt, R-Mo., another member of the intelligence committee, said Trump implored him to "wrap up this investigation" while the two were on board Air Force One over the summer. Sen
