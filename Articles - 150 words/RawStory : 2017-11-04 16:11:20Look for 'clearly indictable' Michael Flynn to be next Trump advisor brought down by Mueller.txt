Kendall Coffey on MSNBC During a panel discussion on MSNBC, an ex-U.S. attorney said he expects former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to be the next domino to fall in the investigation into the Russia’s connections to the White House. Speaking with host Richard Lui on Saturday afternoon, former U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey said he fully expects Flynn to be next because of his extensive financial ties to foreign governments. Asked about the guilty plea agreed to by former Bush adviser George Papadopoulos, Coffey said he was just the tip of the iceberg of Trump officials who might plead out. “Even if you call Papadopoulos a small fry, sometimes the small fries can fry the higher ups depending what they know,” he began before adding, “Right now there has to be a lot of nervous people in Washington” “What are you watching in terms of the next steps for Mueller?”
