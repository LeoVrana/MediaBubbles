Stephen Bannon promised President Trump that he was going "off the chain” to attack GOP donor Paul Singer, Axios reported Sunday. Bannon reportedly called Trump on Friday night after news broke that conservative publication Washington Free Beacon had reportedly helped fund the research that led to a controversial dossier linking Trump to Russia. Singer funds the publication. Bannon told Trump he had wanted "to set things right with Singer and his entire crew” for a long time, according to Axios. Singer, a hedge fund billionaire, is also a top donor for the Republican party and donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. The Washington Examiner first reported Friday that the Washington Free Beacon paid Fusion GPS, the firm that produced the dossier, for anti-Trump research. That research eventually led to the dossier. The Beacon said it had requested opposition research on several Republican candidates and denied any connections to the dossier.
