Such an agreement would have to be terminated if one party began cooperating with prosecutors because of a potential conflict of interest that could damage the non-cooperating defendant. The Times reports: Mr Flynn’s lawyers had been sharing information with Mr Trump’s lawyers about the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining whether anyone around Mr Trump was involved in Russian efforts to undermine Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. That agreement has been terminated, the four people said. Defense lawyers frequently share information during investigations, but they must stop when doing so would pose a conflict of interest. It is unethical for lawyers to work together when one client is cooperating with prosecutors and another is still under investigation. The notification alone does not prove that Mr Flynn is cooperating with Mr Mueller. Some lawyers withdraw from information-sharing arrangements as soon as they begin negotiating with prosecutors.
