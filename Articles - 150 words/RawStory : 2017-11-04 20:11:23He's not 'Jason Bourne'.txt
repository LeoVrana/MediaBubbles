Manafort, who ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate Richard Gates earlier this week pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury. The charges included conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russia government. In the Saturday court filing, Manafort offered to limit his travel to New York, Washington and Florida. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had said on Thursday initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing
