Various White House aides have expressed concern regarding special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing probe into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite reassurances from White House lawyer Ty Cobb, according to The Washington Post. The Post reported that some White House aides have taken comfort in Cobb's reassurances that the probe will wrap up soon, and that Mueller has so far treated those he has interviewed "fairly." However, others view the reassurances as "naive," according to the newspaper. While Trump reportedly likes Cobb's reassurances, others close to him have expressed concerns about the lawyer, the Post reported. Former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon has pressed Trump to hire an experienced criminal defense attorney instead, arguing that Cobb and his team don't compare to Mueller's seasoned team of lawyers, according to the Post. The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment. A source close to
