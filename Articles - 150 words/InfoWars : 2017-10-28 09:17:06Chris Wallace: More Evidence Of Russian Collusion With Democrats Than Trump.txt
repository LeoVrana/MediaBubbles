Fox News’ Chris Wallace remarked Friday that there is more evidence of Democratic colluding with Russia than there is evidence of Republican collusion. Wallace said, “The fact that Hillary Clinton or at least her campaign and the DNC was doing business with a foreign national, a British spy to get information from the Russians for this dossier certainly blunts the idea, ‘Well, it was the Trump campaign and it was outrageous the Trump campaign had anything to do with the Russians to maybe effect at the election’ because this is far more evidence we’ve ever seen involving President Trump and his campaign that the Democrats were directly involved in trying to get information from the Russians to affect the 2016 campaign.”
