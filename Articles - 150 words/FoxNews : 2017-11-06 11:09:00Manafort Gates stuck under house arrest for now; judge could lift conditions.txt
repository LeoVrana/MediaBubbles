Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates will remain under home confinement and GPS monitoring for now, until their attorneys can reach an agreement with the government. In a hearing Monday, a federal judge said she's inclined to remove from house arrest the former chairman of President Donald Trump's campaign and his business associate. But US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson did not immediately rule at Monday's court session, saying she needs more financial information from Manafort and Gates. Manafort has offered up his three residences and life insurance policies toward a $10 million bail. Gates has offered up his residence and life insurance policies toward his $5 million bail. Both have to prove to the government their actual holdings with those dollar amounts if they want to be released from home confinement and GPS monitoring. The men have been indicted as part of Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s Russia
