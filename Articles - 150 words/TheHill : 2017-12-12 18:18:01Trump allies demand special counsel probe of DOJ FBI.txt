On Tuesday, he told The Hill that he was concerned that the alleged Trump-Russia connection is the only aspect of the 2016 campaign being investigated. “I’ve asked for a special counsel but I’d have to limit it to the things that involve political interference in the Justice Department and the FBI, things that Mueller’s not doing,” Grassley said. “[Mueller’s] just Trump-Russia … but we’re also — we come across questions that involve GPS, it involves Russia but it also involves the Democrats.”
