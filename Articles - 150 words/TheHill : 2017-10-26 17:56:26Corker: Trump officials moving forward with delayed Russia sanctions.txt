Sen Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips (R-Tenn.) on Thursday said the Trump administration is moving forward with a new set of sanctions targeting Russia, a step that comes after weeks of delay. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that the State Department will soon identify entities in the Russian intelligence and defense sectors in line for sanctions. The GOP chairman said the administration's move "is a good first step in responsibly implementing a very complex piece of legislation, and I appreciate Secretary Tillersonâ€™s attention to this important issue." "Congress will expect thorough and timely consultation until full implementation is complete," Corker added. The statement from Corker, a vocal critic of President Trump, comes a day after he vowed to get answers from the White House on why the sanctions had been delayed. "I'm going to get on the phone with someone," Corker said Wednesday.
