Richard Gates, a former Trump campaign aide, has reportedly hired new attorneys to defend him against charges stemming from the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling. Gates, an associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of money laundering and tax fraud that predate the 2016 campaign. Gates has hired attorneys Walter Mack of New York and Shan Wu of Washington, Reuters reported Thursday. Mack is a former assistant US attorney, and Wu is a former federal prosecutor. At his court appearance on Monday, Gates was represented by a public defender. He is due to appear in court again Thursday. Gates was ousted from the pro-Trump group America First Policies in April and terminated from his job at the real-estate company Colony NorthStar on Tuesday.
