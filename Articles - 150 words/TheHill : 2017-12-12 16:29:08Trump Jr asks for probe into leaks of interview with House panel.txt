An attorney for Donald Trump Jr. is asking the House Intelligence Committee to investigate leaks of Trump Jr.’s interview with the panel last week, according to a new report. The letter sent Tuesday to Rep Mike Conaway Kenneth (Mike) Michael (R-Calif.) recused himself earlier this year. The letter claims that members of the panel leaked information while the interview was ongoing. Trump Jr.'s lawyer Alan Futerfas cited tweets from CNN reporter Manu Raju sent out at 1:01 p.m. and 4:29 p.m., as well as a CNN story published at 6:25 p.m., as evidence of leaking. Trump Jr. met voluntarily last week with the House Intelligence Committee for an eight-hour interview that focused on his contacts with Russians. The interview lasted from about 10 a.m. until 5:50 p.m., Futerfas said. CNN reported that the president’s eldest son testified that he did not directly speak with his father about his initial statement
