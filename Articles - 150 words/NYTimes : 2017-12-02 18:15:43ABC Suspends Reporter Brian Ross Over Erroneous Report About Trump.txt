The network’s tweet about the claim was shared more than 25,000 times before ABC deleted it, according to The Washington Post. ABC said the confidant later clarified that Mr Trump’s request to Mr Flynn during the campaign had been to find ways to repair relations with Russia. The directive to contact Russian officials on topics that included working together against the Islamic State came after the election, the network said. “It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience — these are our core principles,” the ABC statement said. “We fell far short of that yesterday.” Kathleen Culver, the director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the mistake would give fresh ammunition to Mr Trump and other conservatives who have attacked the credibility of news organizations, especially those that have reported negatively on the administration.
