Sen Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called for an investigation into Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis after it was revealed that Ross had failed to disclose shared business interests with members of Russia President Vladimir Putin’s family. “Why do so many Trump associates have such trouble disclosing relationships with Russia?” Blumenthal tweeted Sunday about the new report. “In concealing an ongoing financial relationship w/ Russian oligarchs, Sec. Ross misled me, Senate Commerce Committee & the American people,” he tweeted. “Inexcusable and intolerable. Americans are owed answers on this Cabinet's troubling failure to disclose links to Russian interests.” “With Wilbur Ross revelations, question must be asked - whose interests come first in this Administration? Only after a thorough investigation can Americans be sure Secretary Ross really has their best interests at heart.” Why do so many Trump associates have such trouble disclosing relationships with Russia? https://t.co/VUChe0vcFt — Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) November 5,
