House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) is resigning due to potential fallout over the debunked Russia dossier now threatening to take down high-level FBI officials as well as the brewing scandal involving former House IT staffer Imran Awan. Ryan, who was never a fan of Donald Trump, isn’t far removed from the key players involved in the dossier, including GOP super donor Paul Singer, whose web site, the Washington Free Beacon, was reportedly the first to hire dossier maker Fusion GPS to probe Trump’s background. The FBI may have used the dossier, which claimed Trump had “golden shower” parties with foreign hookers, as “justification” to spy on Trump’s presidential campaign. Furthermore, as early as Sept. 2016, Ryan knew House computer servers were likely compromised, leading to the theft of $16 million, yet he stayed silent because the revelations would have boosted Trump’s campaign, according to DC insiders who spoke to Infowars.
