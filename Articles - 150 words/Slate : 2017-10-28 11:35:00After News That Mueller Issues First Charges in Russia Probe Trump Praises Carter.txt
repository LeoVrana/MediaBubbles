President Donald Trump woke up Saturday morning, and, as has become the norm now, started tweeting. But he did not comment on the bombshell news that a federal grand jury had issued the first charges in the investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling in the presidential election.

Trump thanked former President Jimmy Carter for saying the news media have been uncharacteristically harsh on his administration. “Just read the nice remarks by President Jimmy Carter about me and how badly I am treated by the press (Fake News),” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Thank you Mr. President!” Just read the nice remarks by President Jimmy Carter about me and how badly I am treated by the press (Fake News).
