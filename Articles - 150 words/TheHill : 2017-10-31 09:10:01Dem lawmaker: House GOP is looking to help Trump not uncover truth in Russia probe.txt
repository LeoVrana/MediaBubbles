Rep Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said in an interview Monday that congressional Republicans appear to be helping the White House rather than taking the House Intelligence Committee’s probe into Russia’s election interference seriously. "At best it's been an incuriosity and at worse it looks like it's been working in partnership with the White House to tell their narrative and not to, you know, take back our freedom to choose in the next election," Swalwell told CNN’s Jake Tapper. Swalwell sits on the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of several Congressional probes into Russia’s attempts to meddle in the United States election and any potential ties between Trump campaign staff members and Russia. The Democratic congressman called for his Republican colleagues to "get serious," a remark that comes after former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former business partner were charged in a 12-count indictment Monday.
