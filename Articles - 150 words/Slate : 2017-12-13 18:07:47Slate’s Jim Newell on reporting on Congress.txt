It’s never been an easy job covering the ins and outs of Congress, but with the Republicans making multiple efforts to kill the Affordable Care Act earlier this summer and recently passing their tax bill in the Senate in a late-night vote, it’s safe to say it’s been quite a year.

Chau Tu: Can you take us into a typical day going up to Capitol Hill and reporting? Jim Newell: On Mondays I usually go in late because that's the day that they're [Congress people] all flying in from their districts and states and they hold a late afternoon vote in both the House and the Senate usually.
