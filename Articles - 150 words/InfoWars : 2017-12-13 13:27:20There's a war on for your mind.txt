Democratic Rep Steve Cohen (Tenn.) said on Wednesday that “everyone respects” Special Counsel Robert Mueller, but was interrupted by Republican Rep Louie Gohmert (Texas), who disagreed. Mediaite flagged a portion of Wednesday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing during the questioning of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein when Cohen asked him if he believed Mueller was the right man for the job of investigating collusion with Russia in the 2016 elections. “I believe based upon his reputation, his service, his patriotism, and his experience with the department and with the FBI, I believe he was an ideal choice for this task,” Rosenstein said.
