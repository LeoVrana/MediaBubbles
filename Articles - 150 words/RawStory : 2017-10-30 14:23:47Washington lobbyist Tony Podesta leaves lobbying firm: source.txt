Tony Podesta (podesta.com) Prominent Democratic Washington lobbyist Tony Podesta has stepped down from his lobbying firm Podesta Group, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. Podesta stepped down on the same day that a special counsel indicted Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for U.S. President Donald Trump, and an associate. Podestaâ€™s firm has come under increasing scrutiny for its lobbying activities on behalf of pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine who Manafort had also been associated with.
