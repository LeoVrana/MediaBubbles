Congress has been investigating possible Trump campaign collusion with the Kremlin for nearly 10 months, but a top Senate Democrat says she has still not seen evidence to support the allegation. “Have you seen any evidence that this dirt, these emails, were ever given to the Trump campaign?” CNN’s Jake Tapper asked California Sen Dianne Feinstein on Sunday. “Not so far,” replied the Democrat, who is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Both panels are investigating various aspects of Russian interference in the presidential campaign.
