Former CIA acting Director and Deputy Director John McLaughlin criticized President Trump's handling of US-Russian relations in a Politico editorial on Friday, saying the Russian leader was "outsmarting" his US counterpart. "What the president doesn’t get is that it’s OK to tell the Russians you know they are lying. It actually doesn’t have to get in the way of dealing with them. Just get it out of the way and move on to business. They respect you most when they know that you know what you are talking about," McLaughlin wrote, referring to Trump's comments last week in which he said he believes that Putin actually believes Russians did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election. "Until the president forcefully demands a federal effort to tighten our defenses for the 2018 and 2020 elections, the federal, state, and local efforts will move slowly and without sufficient urgency," he said.
