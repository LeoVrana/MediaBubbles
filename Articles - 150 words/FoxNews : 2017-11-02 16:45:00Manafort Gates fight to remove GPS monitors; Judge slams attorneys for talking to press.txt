Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates fought in federal court Thursday to “alleviate” their GPS monitoring system, as well as the terms of their home confinement after both pleaded not guilty to 12 counts by a federal grand jury. Manafort and Gates appeared before Federal Judge Amy Jackson on Thursday afternoon, after being indicted as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort appeared in court with his attorney Kevin Downing. Gates, who was previously represented by a public defender and just Wednesday brought on a team of white-collar attorneys Walter Mack and Shan Wu, appeared in court Thursday with Wu. Thursday is the first time Fox News has learned of a “GPS monitoring system,” which both Manafort and Gates have been wearing since being taken into custody on Monday.
