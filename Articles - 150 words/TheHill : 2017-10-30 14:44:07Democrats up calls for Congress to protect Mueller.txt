Democrats are doubling down on their push to limit the Trump administration’s ability to unilaterally fire Robert Mueller as the special counsel’s probe heats up. Mueller unveiled charges against former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Richard Gates on Monday. The special counsel’s office also announced that former Trump campaign aide George Papadopolous has pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators. Democratic lawmakers are warning in light of the charges that the probe into Russia’s election interference and potential ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign must be allowed to continue unimpeded.
