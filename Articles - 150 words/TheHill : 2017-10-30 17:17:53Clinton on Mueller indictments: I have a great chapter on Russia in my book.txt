Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham responded to news of the first charges in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into ties between President Trump’s campaign and Russia by telling guests at a book signing that she wrote “a great chapter about Russia in here.” “You can find out what happened and what is still happening,” she said with a laugh, holding up a copy of her book “What Happened.” The exchange was captured in a video shared by ABC News.

Clinton signed copies of her book at a store in Winnetka, Ill., Monday afternoon. Organizers said there would be no speech or presentation and attendees were required to put away all phones and other devices before approaching the former presidential candidate
