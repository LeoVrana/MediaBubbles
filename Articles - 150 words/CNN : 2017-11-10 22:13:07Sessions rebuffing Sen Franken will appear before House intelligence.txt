(CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions is not expected to respond Friday to Sen Al Franken's most recent demand for additional information on any Trump campaign contacts with Russian officials, according to a Justice Department source. Last week, unsealed court documents in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation revealed new details on a March 2016 campaign meeting with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, Sessions, foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, and others where the possibility of setting up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was discussed. Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, gave Sessions until Friday to answer a number of questions about this new information in an eight-page letter . It's unclear whether Sessions will respond at a later date. Sessions has continued to steadfastly deny any improper contacts with the Russians since he recused himself from any existing or future investigations related to President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign back
