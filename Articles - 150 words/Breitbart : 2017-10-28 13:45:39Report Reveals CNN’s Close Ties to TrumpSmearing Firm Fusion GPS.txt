As more details emerge about the murky swamp that funded Fusion GPS’s work on the salacious Trump dossier, a new report reveals CNN’s own ties to the smear-for-hire firm. CNN’s justice correspondent Evan Perez, who has reported extensively on the Russia investigation and the Trump dossier, is close personal friends with Fusion GPS’s founders, according to a report by the Daily Caller. Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and Perez both worked at the Wall Street Journal together and regularly co-authored national security stories. Thomas Catan, another Fusion co-founder, also worked as a reporter for the Journal at the same time as Perez and Simpson. A third co-founder, Peter Fritsch, was Perez and Simpson’s senior national security editor. Simpson and Fritsch left the Journal in 2011 to launch Fusion, and Perez went to CNN in 2013. Another Journal reporter, Neil King, joined Fusion in December 2016. The Daily Caller discovered Facebook
