Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his former business associate Rick Gates pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of conspiracy against the United States and money laundering in connection with Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in the election. Manafort's bail was set at $10 million, or roughly 10 times his spending on antique rugs. Gates' bail was set at $5 million. Both men were placed under house arrest. Manafort and Gates, "together with others," from around 2006 to 2017, "conspired to defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functions" of the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury, the indictment alleges. Manafort and Gates were also charged with conspiring to launder money, failing to report financial interests in a foreign country, lying in documents in which agents of other governments are meant to disclose their relationship with those other countries,
