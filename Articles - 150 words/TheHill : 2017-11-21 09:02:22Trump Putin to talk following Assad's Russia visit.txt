Russian President Vladimir Putin will call President Trump on Tuesday as Moscow tries to jump-start diplomatic efforts to resolve the Syrian civil war. The call comes after a rare meeting between Putin and Syrian leader Bashar Assad in the Russian resort town of Sochi. National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton confirmed Trump and Putin will speak Tuesday morning. Putin said he would also speak with other leaders in the region, including the Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. He is also set to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Sochi. Putin lauded Assad’s “results in combating terrorist groups.” “The Syrian people, despite a very difficult ordeal, are gradually moving toward the final and inevitable defeat of the terrorists,” he said, according to the Kremlin. Trump's and Putin's last known conversation occurred earlier this month on the sidelines of an economic summit
