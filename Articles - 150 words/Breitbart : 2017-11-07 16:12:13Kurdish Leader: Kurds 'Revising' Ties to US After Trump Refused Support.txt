The Trump administration’s opposition to the independence referendum approved by northern Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has prompted the Kurds to consider “revising” its mutually beneficial relationship with the United States, according to the region’s former president. In an interview with National Public Radio (NPR), former KRG President Masoud Barzani, who remains an active Peshmerga fighter, suggested that America’s objections to Iraqi Kurdistan’s independence efforts may ultimately push the Kurds towards Russia. “I can say we are going to have a very serious revising of the [KRG’s] relationship [with the US],” declared the former president through an interpreter. “The love, the hope, and the trust that the [Kurdish] people have in the US has declined and is decreasing day after day,” he later affirmed. Barzani, who recently stepped down from the KRG president post, blasted the United States for allegedly remaining “silent” on Baghdad resorting to Iraqi government-sponsored Shiite militias
