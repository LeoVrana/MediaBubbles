Carter Page, a one-time foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, met with Russian government officials during a July 2016 trip to Moscow. As the New York Times reports, Page admitted to meeting with Kremlin operatives during his lengthy House Intelligence Committee hearing yesterday. As the Times points out, the admission spins a different narrative than that which Page presented mere hours before their report was published. On Friday, and again earlier this week, Page mentioned his Russia trip, but did not include his meetings with Kremlin officials, and portrayed the visit as “academic” in nature. In his CNN interview on Friday, Page also decried the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant the FBI obtained to monitor him due to suspicions that he is a Russian foreign agent.
