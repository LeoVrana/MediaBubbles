Rep Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, has spent close to 21 hours on television since President Donald Trump took office. According to research provided to The Daily Caller by the Republican National Committee, Schiff has been on TV for 20 hours, 44 minutes, and 49 seconds. Schiff has spent much of his time on TV talking about the investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and has been a major proponent of the Russia collusion narrative. However, despite all of that discussion time, Schiff still hasn’t been able to produce a shred of evidence for his claims. Back in March, for example, Schiff claimed on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that there was “circumstantial evidence” pointing to collusion with the Russians. Yet when TheDC asked him about that “evidence” in July, Schiff chose not to expand on his comments or provide any evidence. (RELATED: Five
