Story highlights Sessions will appear before the House Judiciary Committee on November 14 The letter was signed by every Democratic member of the House judiciary committee Washington (CNN) Democratic lawmakers on the House judiciary committee intend to press Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his "inconsistencies" on the Trump campaign's Russia connections when he appears before their committee next week. In a letter sent Tuesday , the lawmakers note that one of the Trump campaign's foreign policy advisers, George Papadopoulos, acknowledged to FBI investigators that he told several Trump campaign officers about his outreach to the Russia government. The Democrats charge Sessions was inconsistent with details on the campaign's relationship with Russia, saying he's contradicted his own sworn testimony several times, and want more details about the Papadopoulos statement. The letter cites several times when Sessions testified at congressional hearings and had different responses about the campaign's meetings with Russian officials.
