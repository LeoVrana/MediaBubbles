House Rep Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) called on Special Counsel Robert Mueller — who is investigating alleged Russian collusion with the Trump 2016 campaign — to resign because there is an apparent conflict of interest involving Mueller and an alleged campaign to undermine the president and force him from office. Rep Gaetz also called for a special prosecutor to investigate the Uranium One scandal, the Clinton Foundation, and the Fusion GPS firm, which produced the “Russian dossier” alleging Trump-Russia collusion and which was paid by Obama for America’s law firm, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation is, in part, based on the Fusion GPS-provided “dossier.” “We are at risk of a coup d’état in this country if we allow an unaccountable person [Mueller] with no oversight to undermine the duly-elected president of the United States,” said Gaetz in a Nov. 8 speech
