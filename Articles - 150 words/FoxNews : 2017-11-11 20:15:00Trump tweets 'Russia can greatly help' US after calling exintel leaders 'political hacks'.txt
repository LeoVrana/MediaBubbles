On the homestretch of his whirlwind trip to Asia, President Donald Trump tweeted a defense of his efforts to establish a rapport with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that the Kremlin "can greatly help" Washington with global trouble spots. "When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing[?]" asked Trump before accusing critics of "always playing politics -- bad for our country." "I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!" Trump added. The tweet was part of a series of posts Trump made from Vietnam early Sunday morning. They included criticism of "Crooked Hillary Clinton," former President Barack Obama, and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. "Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?'" the president wrote.
