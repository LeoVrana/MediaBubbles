Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's tweet last weekend about fired national security adviser Michael Flynn sparked consideration among the President's staff of imposing new rules on how messages are posted on his social media accounts amid consternation by his aides and lawyers, according to sources familiar with the situation. Trump vented privately at the time that the message had caused more trouble on a topic -- the Russia investigation -- that has clouded his presidency. He expressed indignation that the tweet, combined with Flynn's guilty plea itself, had obscured the Senate's approval of a sweeping tax cut package. It's not clear whether new restrictions on Trump's Twitter were put in place. In the days since, the President has largely steered clear of tweeting about controversial matters like the Russia probe. But as with past pauses in his Twitter habits, there's little expectation among Trump's staff that he'll be quiet for long.
