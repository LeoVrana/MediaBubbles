Sam Clovis, a former Trump campaign official who has become entangled in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, has withdrawn his nomination for a top post in the Agriculture Department. “We respect Mr Clovis’s decision to withdraw his nomination," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. CNN reported Clovis's nomination was in danger of being pulled after it was revealed he had encouraged George Papadopoulos to set up a meeting with Russian officials while working as a foreign policy adviser on the Trump campaign. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians. Clovis was nominated to be the Agriculture Department's chief scientist. He was already facing scrutiny over his apparent lack of credentials for the post.
