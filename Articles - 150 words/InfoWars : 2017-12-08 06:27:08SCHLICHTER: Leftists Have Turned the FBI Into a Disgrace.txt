Add this infamy to all the other crimes of the liberal establishment – its poisonous influence has converted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the eyes of the American people, from a proud institution dedicated to upholding the law into just another suppurating bureaucratic pustule. Where once we saw FBI agents as heroes – many of us ancients grew up watching Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., every Sunday night – now we see careerist hacks looking to suck-up to the Democrat elite while bending the law and subverting justice to do it. Truly, everything liberals touch dies. The revelations about Oh-So-Special Agent Peter Strozk shouldn’t surprise anyone, as bad as they are. Even that hack Robert Mueller couldn’t keep him all-board the Russia Soft Coup Express after Strozk’s anti-Trump texts to his FBI mistress came out.
