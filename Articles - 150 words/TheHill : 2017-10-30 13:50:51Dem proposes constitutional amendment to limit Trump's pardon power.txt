A House Democrat plans to propose an amendment to the Constitution that would limit presidential pardoning authority in the wake of two Trump campaign aides facing indictments, and a third who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators, in the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Under Rep Steve Cohen Stephen (Steve) Ira (D-Texas), proposed an amendment to the Constitution to prevent the president from issuing a self-pardon in July. Cohen has signed on as a cosponsor of Greenâ€™s proposal, as have Reps. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) and Seth Moulton (Mass.).
