In October, Mr Sessions testified that he knew of nobody in the Trump campaign who had contacts with Russians. “And I don’t believe it happened,” he said then. Court documents in the special counsel investigation have since shown that Mr Sessions led a round-table last year in which a campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, discussed his Russian ties and suggested setting up a meeting between Mr Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. Mr Sessions said he now remembers the round-table discussion and that Mr Papadopoulos attended, but, he said, “I have no clear recollection of the details of what he said.” Mr Sessions seemed more certain about his own response to Mr Papadopoulos: “I pushed back against his suggestion.” He offered an impassioned defense of his previous testimony, saying he did not intentionally mislead anyone about fleeting and forgotten meetings. “You’re accusing me of lying about that?” he said.
