The Democratic lawmaker who led an effort to impeach President Trump Donald John (D-Ga.) and other Democrats have said they would not attend due to Trump's presence. Green brought an impeachment resolution against Trump on Wednesday. While the House overwhelmingly voted against the measure, 58 Democrats supported it. Top Democrats have been cautious about seeking impeachment, awaiting more potential revelations in the federal probe into his campaign's ties to Russia last year.
