Monday’s White House press briefing was another one for the ages as CNN’s self-righteous senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta came ready to rumble against Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, but quickly ran into the proverbial buzzsaw during a debate on liberal media bias. Acosta fetched plenty of support as journalists could be heard shouting throughout the exchange in efforts to heckle Sanders (led by CNN political analyst, Playboy correspondent, and Sentinel Newspapers writer Brian Karem). Politico’s Matthews Nussbaum actually lit the match on this fire, asking Sanders why there’s a “discrepancy” between President Trump’s outrage over mistakes by journalist and government-backed efforts to influence elections (like Russia somehow causing voters to elect Trump).
