Donald Trump Jr. has all the obvious traits of his father: Heâ€™s belligerent, dim, and mired in everlasting childhood. But the presidentâ€™s firstborn is a work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction. He is to Donald J. Trump as a postcard of the Mona Lisa is to the actual Mona Lisaâ€”the image of the thing, absent its original aura. Don Jr. may be as privileged and petty as the president, but his indistinctness prevents him from commanding our gaze the way his dad does. That hasnâ€™t stopped the 39-year-old executive vice president of the Trump Organization from trying to make a strong impression. Consider: Iâ€™m still trying to figure out how letting Americans keep more of THEIR money is looting... but you know logic and such is long gone with the libs. Also socialists likely shouldnâ€™t talk about looting and history in the same sentence. #yourewelcome ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ â€”
