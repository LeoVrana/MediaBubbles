WASHINGTON — A congressional ethics panel cleared Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on Thursday of wrongdoing related to accusations that he improperly disclosed classified information. The House Committee on Ethics opened the inquiry in April after Mr Nunes held a news conference to announce that the Obama administration had collected intelligence on Donald J. Trump’s associates. Mr Nunes had gone public with that information after Mr Trump falsely claimed on Twitter that President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the transition. After the inquiry was opened, Mr Nunes stepped aside from his committee’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, took over. It was not clear whether Mr Nunes would resume his role leading the investigation.
