President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has handed over documents to special counsel Robert Mueller in recent weeks. CNN reported Thursday that Kushner has turned over the documents as Mueller and his team begin looking into the White House adviser's role in Trump's decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey earlier this year. Kushner is not believed to be a target of Mueller's investigation, CNN reported, citing sources close to the White House. Still, that Mueller and his team are asking about Kushner in witness interviews signals that the special counsel investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election in moving closer to the president's inner circle and is also looking at actions taken by Trump administration officials in the White House. According to CNN, Kushner turned over documents related to the campaign and the transition, as well as those related to any contacts with Russian officials.
