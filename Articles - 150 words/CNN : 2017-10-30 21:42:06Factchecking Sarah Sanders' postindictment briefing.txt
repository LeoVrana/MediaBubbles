Washington (CNN) White House press secretary Sarah Sanders used a series of inaccuracies on Monday when she tried to distance President Donald Trump from moves by special counsel Robert Mueller that represent the clearest connection yet between Russia's attempts to meddle in the 2016 election and Trump's campaign. Sanders' answers downplayed the response Papadopoulos received when he pitched the idea of a meeting between Trump campaign officials and "Russian leadership" to discuss US-Russian ties if Trump won the presidency. And played down Manafort's substantial role in the victorious 2016 campaign. Here's a CNN fact-check of Sanders' defense of Trump and the White House: 'Outside the scope of the campaign' Sanders, when pressed on Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, inaccurately stated that the activities outlined in a statement of offense occurred "outside the scope of the campaign." "These were activities that took place outside the scope of the campaign," Sanders said
