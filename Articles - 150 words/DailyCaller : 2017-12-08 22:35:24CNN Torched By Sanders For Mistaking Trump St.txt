CNN had a rough Friday. First, the network had to correct egregious, humiliating fake news in a report about Trump-Russia collusion. Now, it seems CNN cannot get the identities right of White House staff.

Sanders said, “CNN this is definitely not Raj Shah but it is #FakeNews.” Bad way to end the week.
