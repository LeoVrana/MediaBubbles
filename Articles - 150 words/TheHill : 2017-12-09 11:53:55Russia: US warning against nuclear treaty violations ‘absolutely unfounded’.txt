Russia on Saturday denied accusations from the Trump administration that the country is violating a decades-old treaty against intermediate range ballistic missiles. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called accusations from the White House that it violated the the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty "completely unfounded." “They are not supported by the technical characteristics of the launch installation which allegedly does not comply with the treaty, or by flight telemetry data.
