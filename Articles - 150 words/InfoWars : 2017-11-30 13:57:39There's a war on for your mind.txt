Longtime Trump associate and Infowars reporter Roger Stone has issued a public statement regarding the nature of his relationship with New York radio personality Randy Credico, who was recently revealed as Stone’s WikiLeaks contact. Stone initially declined to identify the radio host to the House Intelligence Committee because he was concerned the exposure would harm Credico’s career. This week, Credico received a subpoena to appear December 15 before the House Intelligence Committee, which attorney Martin Stolar says he will comply with. Credico tweeted out a picture of the subpoena. Credico joined Infowars War Room to discuss his upcoming testimony. Stone has highlighted the lunacy of the Russian collusion witch-hunt for nearly a year and has complied with the lawmakers at every opportunity, despite being denied the chance to have a public testimony.
