Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been looking into the Trump campaign’s first national security committee meeting, held in March 2016, because of campaign adviser George Papadopoulos’ suggestion that Donald Trump meet with Russian government officials, including Vladimir Putin. The Daily Caller is told by a source familiar with the probe that Trump’s reaction to the proposal from the 30-year-old campaign aide is part of Mueller’s investigation, though it is unclear how significant it is to the sprawling probe being led by the former FBI director. The meeting was held on March 31, 2016 and was attended by Trump, then-Alabama Sen Jeff Sessions and around 10 members of the newly-formed national security advisory committee. It is the only meeting in which Trump and Papadopoulos are known to have attended together. The campaign volunteer attended other meetings in which Sessions was involved. Mueller’s interest in the meeting became apparent earlier this week
