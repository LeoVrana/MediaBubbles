Fox News anchor Chris Wallace said Friday that “there is more evidence at this point of Democratic collusion with the Russians than there is of Republican collusion with the Russians” in last year’s presidential election. Wallace’s commentary comes as Republicans have seized on the revelation that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham and Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who was head of the DNC during the presidential race, all deny knowing of the dossier's existence until after it was released. President Trump slammed what he characterized as the “fake dossier” and characterized it as the foundation of “the whole Russia hoax” in speaking with reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday.
