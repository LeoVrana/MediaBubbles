Attorney General Jeff Sessions could face heat from both sides of the aisle Tuesday, in a widely anticipated appearance before House lawmakers that comes just hours after he revealed that he has ordered top prosecutors to look into "certain issues" involving the Clinton Foundation and the controversial sale of American uranium interests to Russia. Sessions is expected to testify before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday morning, and will face tough questioning from Republicans, who believe he took too long, and Democrats, who consider the potential probes partisan. The appearance comes after Fox News first reported Monday evening that the Justice Department informed committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and other members the issues were on the Department of Justice's radar. Committee members had pressed Sessions to appoint a special counsel to look into alleged wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation and the possibly related sale of Uranium One to a Russian company.
