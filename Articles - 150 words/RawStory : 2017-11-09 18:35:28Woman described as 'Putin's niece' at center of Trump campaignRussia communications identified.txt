As Politico reports, Olga Vinogradova is the name of the “very good-looking” model who was introduced to Papadopoulos in 2016, and may have been a Russian “cut out,” or someone the Kremlin used to infiltrate the Trump campaign. In an email to Trump campaign officials, Papadaooulos said Vinogradova offered “to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump.” “As mentioned we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” Vinogradova said in an email to the Trump campaign staffer. “The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced.” Papadapoulos
