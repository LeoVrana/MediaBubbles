Paul Manafort and Rick Gates (Photos: Screen capture and social media) A U.S. judge on Thursday ordered indicted former Trump campaign advisers Paul Manafort and Richard Gates to remain under home arrest, rejecting for now their pleas for less stringent bail conditions. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson also sharply warned lawyers for the duo not to speak about their case outside of court. “This is a criminal trial and not a public relations campaign,” Jackson said during a hearing. Manafort, 68, who served several months as Trump’s campaign manager, and Gates, 45, who also worked on the Republican’s campaign, pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment, whose charges included conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. A conviction on conspiracy to launder money alone could carry a sentence of up to 20 years
