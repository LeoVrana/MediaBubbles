White House officials have reportedly spoken about the idea of replacing Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore with Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard (R-Ky.) â€” have called for Moore to step aside in the wake of the allegations. Some lawmakers have also raised the idea of a write-in campaign. Earlier this year, President Trump attacked Sessions, who formerly served as an Alabama senator, after his decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In July, following the attacks, Sessions said he did not plan to step down, despite the increasing tension. The Alabama Senate special election to serve out the remainder of Sessions's term, a contest between Moore and Democrat Doug Jones, is set for Dec. 12.
