Roger Stone speaks to a reporter at LAX (Screen capture) On Saturday, Twitter permanently banned Republican “dirty tricks” operative Roger Stone after he made threats against CNN personnel in a bonkers meltdown on Friday night, The Hollywood Reporter said. After CNN announced on Friday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has filed the first charges in his investigation into President Donald Trump’s improper dealings with Russia, Stone went on a spittle-flecked, profane rampage, attacking CNN’s Ana Cabrera and Don Lemon, as well as Eugene Robinson from The Washington Post. On Saturday, Twitter suspended Stone permanently. Friday’s barrage of threats and profanity was the last straw in a series of unhinged attacks on other users by Stone. It's kind of sad that Roger Stone can't see twitter world celebrating the end of his hateful rhetoric. — Pamela Walker (@pamelarwalker) October 29, 2017 Roger Stone has exceeded his lifetime character limit of bile
