President Trump in a Sunday morning tweet denied asking former FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into Michael Flynn during a February meeting after the ex-national security adviser was dismissed from his position. “I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!” the president tweeted early Sunday morning. His tweet came after he also said on Twitter he fired Flynn because “he lied to the Vice President and the FBI” and compared the case to Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. Comey, in his opening statement for the testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, said that Trump had asked him to back off the Flynn investigation during an Oval Office meeting on Feb 14. Flynn had already been fired from his position in the administration over revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about his communications with Russia’s ambassador
