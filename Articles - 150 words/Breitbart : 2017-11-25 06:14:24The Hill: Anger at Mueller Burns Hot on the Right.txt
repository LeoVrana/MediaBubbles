From Fox News to Breitbart and on talk radio, conservative media has been drawing attention to Mueller’s relationship with fired former FBI director James Comey and his hiring of Democrats for his investigative team. They also argue Mueller has already gone far beyond his mandate of investigating Russian interference in the election. Conservative media has taken a new tack against Mueller in recent weeks, zeroing in on the sale of Uranium One to the Russia state-owned nuclear firm Rosatom. The deal, which at the time gave Russia ownership of about 20 percent of America’s uranium production capacity, was approved by nine members on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in 2010, while President Obama was in office. Mueller was the director of the FBI at the time.
