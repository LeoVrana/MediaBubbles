Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham (D-Va.), argued the dossier is opposition research compiled on a political rival. But the former secretary of state also pointed out that the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign was not disclosed prior to the election. “So I know that voters should have had that information. That’s something that may have influenced some people and it’s part of what happens in a campaign where you get information that may or may not be useful and you try to make sure anything you put out in the public arena is accurate,” she said. “So this thing didn’t come out until after the election and it’s still being evaluated, but the fact of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia should have come out.”
