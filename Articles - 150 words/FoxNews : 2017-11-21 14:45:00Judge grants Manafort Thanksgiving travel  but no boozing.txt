A federal judge on Tuesday eased the terms of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's house arrest so he can travel during the Thanksgiving holiday -- with the caveat he will not drink alcohol or remove his GPS ankle monitor. The request was granted by US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, in Washington, D.C., and requested by Manafort lawyer Kevin Downing. The judge also eased the house-arrest terms for Rick Gates, the other Trump campaign official charged last month in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether anybody on President Trump’s 2016 White House team colluded with Russia. Manafort and Rick Gates were charged Oct. 30 in a 12-count indictment related to money laundering, banking and foreign lobbying laws. Each has pleaded not guilty and remains free on bail, though under house arrest. Their trial date is tentatively set for May 7. Manafort and Gates’ “limited purpose” release
