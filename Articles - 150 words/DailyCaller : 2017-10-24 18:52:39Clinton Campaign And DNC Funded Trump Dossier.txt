The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid opposition research firm Fusion GPS to investigate Donald Trump as part of a project that led to the infamous dossier compiled by a former British spy. According to a bombshell report from The Washington Post, Marc E. Elias, a lawyer for the Clinton campaign and DNC coordinated the project. A lawyer at the Beltway law firm Perkins Coie, Elias hired Fusion in April 2016 to investigate Trump. Fusion would later hire former MI6 agent Christopher Steele to investigate Trumpâ€™s activities in Russia. He produced a 35-page dossier consisting of 17 memos dated between June 20, 2016 and Dec. 13. The campaign and DNC paid Fusion through the end of Oct. 2016, according to The Post.
