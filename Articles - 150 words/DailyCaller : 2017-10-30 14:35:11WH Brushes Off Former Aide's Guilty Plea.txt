REUTERS/Carlos Barria White House press secretary Sarah Sanders played down the importance of a former campaign aide pleading guilty for lying to federal officials on Monday. George Papadopoulos, a member of the campaign’s foreign policy advisory, pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 for lying to federal officials about his connections to individuals with alleged ties to the Russian government, according to court documents released Monday. Sanders said during Monday’s White House press briefing that Papadopoulos was simply a “volunteer” like “thousands” of others during the campaign.
