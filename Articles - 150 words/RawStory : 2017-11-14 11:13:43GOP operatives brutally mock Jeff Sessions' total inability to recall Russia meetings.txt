U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions joins White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 27, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Two Republican operatives on Tuesday called out Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ declaration that the “chaos” of Donald Trump’s campaign rendered him unable to recall meetings in which Trump campaign aides told him of their efforts to reach out to Russian government officials. John Weaver, who served as top strategist for Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich’s 2016 presidential campaign, mocked Sessions on Twitter for having a “possum memory” and noted that most people would remember conversations in which campaign officials floated the idea of getting help from hostile foreign powers to defeat their opponents. “Jeff, I’ve been involved in scores of presidential campaigns and politely suggest meetings with Russians or discussions about the candidate meeting with Putin… ANYONE would remember,” he wrote.
