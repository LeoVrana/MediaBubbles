Iraq announced Saturday that the country's war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is over after more than three years of fighting. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the country's forces were in full control of Iraq's border with Syria, according to The Associated Press, while a spokesman said it marked the end of the military fight. “All Iraqi lands are liberated from terrorist Daesh gangs and our forces completely control the international Iraqi-Syrian border,” a top Iraqi general said after al-Abadi's remarks, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS, the AP reported.
