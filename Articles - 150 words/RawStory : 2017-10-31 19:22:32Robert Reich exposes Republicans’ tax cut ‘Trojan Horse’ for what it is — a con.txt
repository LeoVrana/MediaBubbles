In the midst of news about special counsel Robert Mueller’s first and most recent indictments in his Russia investigation lies the ever-looming possibility of President Donald Trump’s proposed tax cuts for the wealthy. According to former Clinton Labor secretary Robert Reich, those cuts, if passed, will be disastrous. Republicans are “selling this to the public with the false claim that the middle class will benefit from their tax cut plan,” Reich explained. “It’s a gigantic Trojan horse.” “For most Americans,” he continued, “the proposed tax cuts are tiny and temporary.” These cuts will “shrink in just a few years,” and some members of the American middle class will actually see an increase in their taxes — all while the richest Americans will save an average $129,000
