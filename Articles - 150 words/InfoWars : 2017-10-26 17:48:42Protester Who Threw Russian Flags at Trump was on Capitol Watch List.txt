The liberal protester who earlier this week infiltrated a group of reporters in a secure area of the Capitol, tossed mini-Russian flags and shouted “treason” at President Trump had been on a watch list before Tuesday’s incident, Fox News has learned. The protester was identified as Ryan Clayton, an activist from an anti-Trump group who was later arrested and charged with unlawful conduct. The US Capitol Police Board is conducting an internal investigation into how someone without a press credential – and on a watch list – was able to slip into the secure area and get so close to the president. “This was a monumental f—up,” a senior congressional security source told Fox News.
