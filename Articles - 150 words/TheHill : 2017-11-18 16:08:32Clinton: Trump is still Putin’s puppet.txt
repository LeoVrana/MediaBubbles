Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham said in an interview published Friday that she stands by her claim during the 2016 election that President Trump would be Russian President Vladimir Putin's "puppet" if he won. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked by Mother Jones whether she still stood by the claim she made during a presidential debate last year. "I do," she responded. “I don’t know how the president of the United States, with all of the concerns about the integrity of our elections, could meet with Putin just recently and basically say, ‘Well, you know, he told me again he didn’t do it,’ ” she added, referring to Trump's statement that he believed Putin's denials that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One last week that he believes Putin "means it" when he denies interfering in the 2016 election,
