The House Intelligence Committee released a lengthy transcript of an interview former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page gave last week. Page, an energy consultant, has been at the center of the multiple investigations into possible campaign collusion with Russia because of his appearance in the infamous dossier of research written by former British spy Christopher Steele.
