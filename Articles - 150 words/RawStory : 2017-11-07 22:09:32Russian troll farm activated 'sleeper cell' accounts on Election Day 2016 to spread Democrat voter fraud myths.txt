On Election Day 2016, as Americans lined up to vote and glued their eyes to screens to watch election news, the infamous Kremlin-linked “troll farm” of St. Petersburg, Russia activated “sleeper cell” accounts to continue their efforts to affect the outcome of the presidential election. According to a report by The Daily Beast, the Internet Research Agency‘s E-Day maneuvers included using “high-profile accounts with large and influential followings” along with “scores of lurking personas established years earlier with stolen photos and fabricated backgrounds” to persuade Twitter users to vote for then-candidate Donald Trump. In an analysis of 6.5 million tweets, the Beast found 80 accounts (of the 2,752 identified by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence as Russian trolls) that mentioned either “Hillary” or “Trump” between November 7-9. “VOTE TRUMP to save ourselves from the New World Order. Time to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” one of the tweets read.
