Photo DANANG, Vietnam — President Trump said on Saturday that he believed President Vladimir V. Putin was sincere in his repeated denials of interference in the 2016 presidential elections, calling the investigations into Moscow’s meddling a politically motivated “hit job” that is hindering cooperation with Russia on life-or-death issues. Speaking after meeting privately with Mr Putin on the sideline of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Danang, Vietnam, Mr Trump said he had again asked whether Russia had meddled in the contest, but the continued focus on the issue was insulting to Mr Putin. He suggested it was time to move past the issue so that the United States and Russia could cooperate on confronting the nuclear threat from North Korea, solving the Syrian civil war, and working together on Ukraine. “He said he didn’t meddle — I asked him again,” Mr Trump told reporters traveling with him
