(CNN) US prosecutors have objected to an entry request for Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who became known for attending the June 2016 meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower. Veselnitskaya, an attorney for Cyprus-based company Prevezon Holdings and its Russian owner, Denis Katsyv, asked for immigration parole, an alternative to the visa process, to attend a hearing to finalize a $5.9 million civil forfeiture settlement reached with the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. US authorities have accused Prevezon as being a front for a money-laundering operation that moved cash out of Russia and washed the money through Manhattan real estate. "The government's position here -- that immigration parole is unwarranted in the absence of a concrete and imminent need for testimony -- is thus consistent with the regulations and its previous positions in this case," a lawyer for the government wrote in a letter
