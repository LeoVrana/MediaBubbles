A President Donald Trump supporter said Monday he would have to double check with the president if Jesus Christ himself said the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Trump voter panelist: “If Jesus Christ gets down off the cross and told me Trump is with Russia, I would tell him, ‘Hold on a second. I need to check with the President if it’s true.'” pic.twitter.com/4f8bXkXzhY — New Day (@NewDay) November 20, 2017 Ruben Estrada, a small business owner and Trump voter, told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota that he feels Trump is looking out for the “small guy” and suggested the President is beyond reproach in his view. “If Jesus Christ gets down off the cross and told me Trump is with Russia, I would say hold on a second I need to check with the President if its true,” Estrada said. “Why do you believe Donald trump over everybody else,” Camerota responded.
