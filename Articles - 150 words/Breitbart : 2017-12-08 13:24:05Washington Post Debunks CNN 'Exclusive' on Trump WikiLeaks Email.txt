CNN published an exclusive Russia story Friday, reporting that an unearthed email indicated that WikiLeaks may have reached out to then-candidate Donald Trump’s team during the campaign to offer hacked documents — only for the story to be undermined hours later by the Washington Post. The article, titled, “Exclusive: Email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents” and written by Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb, reported that the Trump team was sent an email on September 4, a month before the John Podesta emails would be leaked day-by-day to the public via WikiLeaks and three weeks before Trump Jr. exchanged direct messages with the outlet on Twitter. That email offered a website and decryption key to the team. CNN reported: Congressional investigators are trying to ascertain whether the individual who sent the September email is legitimate and whether it shows additional efforts by WikiLeaks to connect with Trump’s son
