Sen Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) emphasized on Thursday what he says is the significance of reports saying a data research firm tied to the Trump campaign reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the 2016 presidential campaign. "It is significant because it demonstrates evidence of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian interference," Blumenthal told CNN's Anderson Cooper. "Here we have more evidence of a pattern that has been established of collusion and perhaps of obstruction of justice," he continued, referring to the president's repeated claims that probes into alleged collusion are a hoax. Blumenthal's comments come after The Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that the head of Cambridge Analytica, which was affiliated with the Trump campaign, contacted Assange about finding former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonChris Murphyâ€™s profile rises with gun tragedies DNC, RNC step up cyber protections Gun proposal picks up GOP support
