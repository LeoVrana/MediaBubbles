(CNN) Former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page told the House intelligence committee last week that he floated the idea of then-candidate Donald Trump taking a trip to Russia in May 2016, according to transcript of his interview. "The idea there was bearing in mind Barack Obama's speech as a candidate in Germany 2008. That was what I was envisioning," Page told lawmakers in more than six hours of closed-door testimony Thursday. Page raised the idea of an Obama-like foreign speech for Trump in Russia with JD Gordon, who was running the foreign policy adviser team, and another adviser, Walid Phares. In his email to the two advisers in May 2016, Page wrote about Trump: "If he'd like to take my place (on a trip to Russia) and raise the temperature a little bit, of course I'd be more than happy to yield this honor to him."
