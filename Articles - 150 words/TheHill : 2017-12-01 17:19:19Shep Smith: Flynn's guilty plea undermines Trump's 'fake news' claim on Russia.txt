Journalists are pointing to former national security adviser Michael Flynn's guilty plea on Friday to dismiss President Trump's claim of "fake news" that he has used to push back on the Russia probe. Fox News anchor Shepard Smith and CNN anchor Jake Tapper both invoked the plea deal Friday to push back on the White House's use of the term "fake news." "With the Special Counsel and FBI verifying so many news reports from the last year, seems pretty clear why the WH and its vassals have deployed the term 'fake news' to attack accurate stories," Tapper wrote on Twitter.
