Former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is concerned about his son’s potential legal exposure in the ongoing investigation into Russia’s ties to the 2016 election, CNN reported Wednesday. Flynn’s worries could factor into decisions about how to respond to special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, multiple sources told CNN. NBC reported on Sunday that Mueller has obtained enough evidence to charge Flynn and Michael Flynn Jr., his son. Flynn would be the first current or former Trump administration official to be charged in Mueller’s probe. Flynn left the White House in February after he misled key administration officials, including Vice President Pence, about his previous contact with Russian officials. Michael Flynn Jr. often traveled and worked with his father during the campaign. He responded to his critics Sunday on Twitter, saying “the disappointment on your faces when I don’t go to jail will be worth all your harassment.”
