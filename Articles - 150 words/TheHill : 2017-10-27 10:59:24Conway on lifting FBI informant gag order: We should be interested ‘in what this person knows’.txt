White House adviser Kellyanne Conway responded to reports that President Trump told aides to pressure the Justice Department to allow an FBI informant to testify before Congress on Friday by saying that Trump wants the truth to be revealed. Conway told CNN's "New Day" that the informant, who was involved in the FBI probe of corruption in the Russian energy sector during the Obama administration, should be free to speak with Congress, and that Trump was trying to expedite that process. "He believes, as many others do, frankly, that the FBI informant should be free to say what he knows," Conway said Friday. "We should all be interested in what this person knows." "It's not unusual for a President to weigh in," she added. Trump and Republicans are demanding answers into a 2010 deal authorized by the Obama administration to sell a uranium mining company to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency,
