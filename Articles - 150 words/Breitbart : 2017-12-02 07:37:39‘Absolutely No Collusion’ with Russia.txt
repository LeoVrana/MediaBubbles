President Donald Trump said that former National Security Director Mike Flynn’s decision to plead guilty and testify in the Russian collusion investigation does not worry him. “What has been shown is no collusion. There has been absolutely no collusion,” Trump said. “So we’re very happy.” Trump spoke to reporters as he left for a series of fundraising events in New York City, breaking his silence about Flynn’s decision to cooperate with the special investigation headed by Robert Mueller and plead guilty to making false statements to the FBI. The president also commented about the ongoing investigation on Twitter, noting that he fired Flynn for lying to the FBI. “He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful,” he wrote. “There was nothing to hide!” I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.
