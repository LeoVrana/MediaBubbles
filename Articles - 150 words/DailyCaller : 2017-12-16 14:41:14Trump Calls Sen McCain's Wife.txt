REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst - RC1BC506A110 President Donald Trump called the wife of Arizona Sen John McCain to check on her husband, who is currently hospitalized for cancer treatments. The White House told CNBC that Trump called Cindy McCain Friday to check on her husband’s health and to give the family his best wishes on a safe recovery after the Republican senator was hospitalized Wednesday afternoon due to side effects from his cancer treatment. Doctors diagnosed McCain with brain cancer in July, and he was hospitalized the same month for surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye. Subsequent tests revealed a primary brain tumor associated with the blood clot. (RELATED: McCain Says His Cancer Is ‘Vicious’) McCain returned to the Senate two days
