As news of former National Security Advisor Micheal Flynn’s guilty plea broke Friday morning, ousted FBI director James Comey appeared to mock the Trump administration on Twitter. The tweet is the latest in a long-running war of words raging between Comey and Trump since the president dismissed Comey this past May. Comey’s firing, apparently at the advice of White House adviser and Presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, is broadly understood to have led to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s decision to appoint Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It was Mueller’s investigation that yielded Flynn’s guilty plea for lying to the FBI about phone calls with Russian officials during the presidential transition. Comey quoted the Old Testament’s Book of Amos and linked to a picture of the Potomac River’s Great Falls near Washington, DC: “But justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream” Amos 5:24 https://t.co/o89PSY1YBd — James Comey (@Comey)
