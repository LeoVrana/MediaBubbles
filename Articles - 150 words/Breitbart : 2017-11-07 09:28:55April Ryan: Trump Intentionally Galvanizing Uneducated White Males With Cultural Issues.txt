Monday on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan said President Donald Trump fights his low approval rating by galvanizing his base of “uneducated” white males with cultural issues like the Confederacy and NFL players taking a knee. Partial transcript as follows: LEMON: April, let’s talk about the president’s approval rating. He’s at the lowest point overall. Just 36% say that they approve the way Trump is handling his job as president. How does the White House explain those low poll numbers which have been consistent throughout his presidency? RYAN: Well, they are very reactionary and deflective. They’re blaming it on the Russia investigation. they’re blaming it on Democrats. And it’s interesting, Democrats who are trying to come up with some wins, particularly in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, they’re blaming everything on the reactionary president for all the problems that we’re having.
