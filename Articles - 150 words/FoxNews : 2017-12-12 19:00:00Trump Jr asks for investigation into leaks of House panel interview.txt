A lawyer for Donald Trump Jr. asked the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday to open an investigation into leaks of Trump Jr.'s testimony last week. Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Donald Trump, appeared before the committee in a closed session Dec. 6 as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In a letter to Rep Mike Conaway, R-Texas, who has been leading the panel's Russia probe, attorney Alan Futerfas accused "members of the Committee and/or their staff" of "selectively leaking information provided during the interview to various press outlets, most notably CNN" while Trump Jr. was still speaking to the committee. Furterfast cited two tweets from CNN reporter Manu Raju, as well as a CNN online story published shortly after the interview, as part of his evidence for the leaks. TRUMP JR.
