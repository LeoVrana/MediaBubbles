RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images) Russian hackers successfully breached Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s email account after targeting campaign staffers for only nine days, the Associated Press reports. The cybersecurity company SecureWorks analyzed the security breach and determined Russian hackers, known as Fancy Bear, were able to evade substantial security measures by sending over 19,000 phishing emails to current and former Clinton campaign workers, supporters and contractors. The forensic investigation also yielded evidence that the hackers were closely aligned with the Russian government. The phishing emails, designed to appear as if they were sent by Google, asked recipients to update their passwords but actually directed them to a website that collected their credentials. The initial volley of emails were sent to Clinton’s 2008 campaign staff on march 10, 2016.
