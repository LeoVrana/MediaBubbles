President Trump’s nominee to the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) top scientist is in danger of being pulled, according to a new report from CNN. Sam Clovis is under scrutiny for actions during his time as Trump's campaign co-chairman. A White House source told CNN that the nomination could be pulled, and another source said that Clovis may withdraw his nomination, either voluntarily or by force. It was reported earlier this week that Clovis was the high-level Trump campaign official who encouraged George Papadopoulos to set up a meeting with Russian officials. Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his relationship with Russian nationals. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that there are no plans to withdraw Clovis’s nomination.
