Fox News cheeseburger emoji story (Photo: Screen capture) Fox News repeatedly interrupted its coverage of Paul Manafort’s indictment on Monday morning. The news network decided to highlight a number of stories that didn’t revolve around President Donald Trump’s former campaign chief, including a story about a cheeseburger emoji. “I googled it and it showed the cheese should be on top of the burger,” Fox and Friends host Steve Doocy complained. From cable news networks to ABC, NBC and CBS morning shows, all reported on the indictment of Manafort and his former associate Rick Gates. Fox News, meanwhile, still maintains that the real Russia scandal involves Hillary Clinton. Trump even praised Fox News on his Twitter feed. Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS. The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK'd! — Donald J.
