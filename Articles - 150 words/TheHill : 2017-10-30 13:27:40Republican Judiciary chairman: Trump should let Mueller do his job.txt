Sen Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest (D-Calif.) told reporters last week that she and Grassley "have decided that each side is going to take a course and we'll share and if the other side wants to participate they can. ... So we are going ahead with some things." Feinstein last Friday sent a first tranche of letters as part of Democrats' new effort, which included questions about Manafort. The split of what was a bipartisan probe appears to have arisen from the GOP push to revisit Obama-era scandals and dig into a controversial opposition research dossier compiled on Trump. Grassley separately told reporters that he is still interested in looking at potential collusion with Russia.
