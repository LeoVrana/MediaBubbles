The House Intelligence Committee announced Saturday that it has reached a settlement to obtain bank records from the private intelligence firm that produced a controversial dossier alleging ties between President Trump and Russia. "The parties have reached an agreement related to the House Intelligence Committee's subpoena for Fusion GPS's bank records that will secure the Committee's access to the records necessary for its investigation," the committee said in a statement. Fusion GPS had hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, to compile the dossier on Trump. House Republicans have sought the firm's bank records to find out who paid for the research. The records could reveal more details about the funding surrounding the project.
