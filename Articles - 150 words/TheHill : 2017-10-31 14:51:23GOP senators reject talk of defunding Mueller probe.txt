Senate Republicans are shooting down the possibility of defunding the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. Several GOP senators said on Tuesday that they wouldn't support a move to crack down on Mueller's investigation, which is looking at Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow. "I would not support that. He needs to continue to investigate. I have confidence in Bob Mueller," Sen Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane (R-La.) noted he would keep an eye on the spending but didn't want to impede Mueller. "I don't want to deny the Justice Department or the special counsel the resources they need. Now I don't want to see them just go hog wild and waste money either, but I don't want to try to do anything to hurt [them]," he said. Jonathan Easley contributed.
