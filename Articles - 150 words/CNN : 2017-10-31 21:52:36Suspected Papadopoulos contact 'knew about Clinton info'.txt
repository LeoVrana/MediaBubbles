London (CNN) An academic suspected of being the link between a Trump campaign adviser and the Russian government told a business contact that Moscow had a trove of information about Hillary Clinton in April 2016, months before the information was public, CNN has learned. Joseph Mifsud, a London-based academic from Malta, also boasted of his connections with Moscow and talked about how he had dinner in a small group with President Vladimir Putin, the business contact and a former assistant told CNN. Mifsud matches the profile of "Foreign Contact 1" in the legal complaint against George Papadopoulos, a one-time Trump adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with foreign contacts. According to unsealed court papers Papadopoulos held a series of meetings in early 2016 with "Foreign Contact 1," also described as "the professor." Papadopoulos and Mifsud were Facebook friends, Papadopoulos' now-deleted Facebook account showed.
