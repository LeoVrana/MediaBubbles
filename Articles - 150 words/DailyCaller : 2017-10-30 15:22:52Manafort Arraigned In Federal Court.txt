Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was arraigned early Monday afternoon in federal court for 12 criminal charges ranging from money laundering to violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The charges are the first secured by special counsel Robert Mueller in connection with his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Appearing just before 2:00 pm at the US District Court for the District of Columbia before US Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson, Manafort plead not guilty to all counts of the indictment. He wore a conservative suit and blue tie, sitting stoically throughout except for short exchanges with his lawyer, Kevin Downing. He did not appear to be accompanied by family, was escorted by US Marshals, and spoke only to give his name and swear an oath. Attorneys Andrew Weissman and Greg Andres appeared for special counsel Robert Mueller. They requested home confinement and a $10 million
