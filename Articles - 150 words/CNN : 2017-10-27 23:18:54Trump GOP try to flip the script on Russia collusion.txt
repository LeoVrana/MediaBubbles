Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his allies in Washington are seizing on a pair of revelations about his former rival Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party aiming to flip the months-long narrative about potential Russian collusion. Republicans this week launched a multi-pronged attack -- from the White House, Capitol Hill and politicos around town -- on Democrats and their former nominee after reports revealed that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee helped fund an opposition research effort that produced a controversial dossier that made allegations (including many salacious and unverified ones) about Trump and his Russian ties; and as new questions surfaced about the circumstances surrounding the sale of a Canadian-based uranium mining company during Clinton's time leading the State Department. Court documents connected with the case reviewed do not reference donations to the Clinton Foundation, nor attempts by US or Russian interests to influence the Uranium One
