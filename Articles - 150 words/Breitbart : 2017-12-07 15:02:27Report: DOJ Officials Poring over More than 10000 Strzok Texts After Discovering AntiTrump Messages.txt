Justice Department officials are poring over more than 10,000 text messages between two ex-FBI agents booted from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe after agents discovered the two made anti-Trump comments. Fox News reports that the department is going through “several months” of text messages from former counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok to FBI attorney Lisa Page, whom he had an affair with. The agency is reviewing the text messages before handing them over to the House Intelligence Committee. The Justice Department’s inspector general discovered this summer that Strzok and Page exchanged messages bashing President Trump and supporting 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. When the inspector general notified Mueller’s office, the FBI removed Strzok from the Russia probe and demoted him to a position in the FBI’s human resources department. Page also left Mueller’s team that summer, but she departed the group before the inspector general got in touch
