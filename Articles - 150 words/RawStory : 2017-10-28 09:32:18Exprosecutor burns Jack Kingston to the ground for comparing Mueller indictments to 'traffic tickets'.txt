Former Congressman Jack Kingston (R-GA) got a lesson in the law Saturday morning for attempting to dismiss the coming indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller as nothing more serious than parking tickets. Since Friday night, Kingston has been put in the unenviable position of defending the Trump administration after news broke that indictments and arrests are forthcoming as early as Monday morning. Appearing on CNN’s New Day, Kingston attempted to tamp down the story by saying the charges and arrests amount to “bullying,” while maintaining there is no evidence of Russian collusion. “I don’t think they’re going to find any evidence of collusion,” Kingston began. “I think they’re going to try to get somebody and use him as a stalking horse to try to get somebody else to say something. But, you know, a little bit of bullying is going on here and I think the timing is very suspect.
