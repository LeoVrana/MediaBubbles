Donald Trump Jr. told House investigators Wednesday he did not communicate directly with his father about how to respond to a pending report about his meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 in Trump Tower, according to a report by CNN. Trump Jr. said, instead, he spoke to White House aide Hope Hicks about how to respond to the reports, who later spoke to the president aboard Air Force One. Trump was reportedly debating between a longer statement and a shorter statement. CNNâ€™s reporting echoes what the Washington Post reported months ago, on July 31, 2017.

Trump Jr. was not on the flight, but he had spoken to Hicks earlier, according to the report. Donald Trump
