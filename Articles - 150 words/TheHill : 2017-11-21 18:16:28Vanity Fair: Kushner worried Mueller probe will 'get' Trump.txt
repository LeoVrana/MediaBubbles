White House senior adviser Jared Kushner is facing a reduced role in the White House and has expressed concern that a special probe into the 2016 presidential election may “get” President Trump, according to a report from Vanity Fair on Tuesday. Kushner, who is married to first daughter Ivanka Trump, has come under scrutiny in recent weeks in special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the election. He reportedly has expressed worry about how far the investigation might go following the indictments of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. “Do you think they’ll get the president?” Kushner reportedly asked a friend. Leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee said last week that Kushner failed to hand over documents discussing WikiLeaks and Russian overtures during the campaign. Kushner’s lawyer said the committee had “jumped the gun” in requesting the emails, adding that Kushner is “the hero” in the emails.
