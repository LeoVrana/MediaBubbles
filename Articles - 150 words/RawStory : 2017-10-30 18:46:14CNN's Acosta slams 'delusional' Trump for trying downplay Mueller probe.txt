President Donald Trump may think the Russian election-interference investigation is “fake news,” but as CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta pointed out following the latest news from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, that belief might be “alternative facts.” “The president appeared to be blind-sided by perhaps the biggest bombshell of the day, the plea deal with former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos,” Acosta said at the beginning of his segment on The Situation Room. “A story the president has called ‘fake news’ got very real for the White House today.” Around the time that news of Papadopoulos’ guilty plea for to lying to federal investigators broke, Trump tweeted regarding the indictment of another of his former aides — one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort, whose financial ties to the Kremlin have been the subject of scrutiny for months.
