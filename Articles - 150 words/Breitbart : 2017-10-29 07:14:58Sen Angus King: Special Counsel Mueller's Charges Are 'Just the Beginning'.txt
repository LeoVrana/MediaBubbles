Sen Angus King on special counsel Mueller's charges: "Whatever it is, it's really just the beginning” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/lPjk9yLbI7 Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while discussing a potential indictment coming in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, Sen Angus King (I-ME) said it was “really just the beginning.” King said, “Like everyone else in Washington, I’ll be watching tomorrow to see what comes out of the Mueller investigation. But I think it’s important to emphasize that this, whatever it is, is really just the beginning. And I’m sure there will be additional evidence, assuming director Mueller uncovers additional evidence. He’s a pro. He’s going to follow the facts where they lead.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
