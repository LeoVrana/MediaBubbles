Jodie Foster reprised her Oscar-winning role as FBI agent Clarice Starling from the 1991 horror film The Silence of the Lambs for a skit on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show Friday night, in which she attempts to get information on possible collusion between President Donald Trump and Russia from an imprisoned Hannibal Lecter, played by Colbert. “You’re one of [Robert] Mueller’s, aren’t you?” Colbert asks Foster, referring to the Special Counsel investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. “Still hunting President Trump?” “We were golfing buddies once,” Colbert-as-Lecter continues. “We ate our caddie, turned him into a taco bowl with a nice Diet Coke.” Clarice (Jodie Foster) has some questions regarding Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump’s ties to Russia directed toward Hannibal Lecter (Stephen Colbert). #LSSC #HannibalLecter pic.twitter.com/sk1xM0AV8S — The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) December 16, 2017 “Doctor, what can you tell me about the president?” Foster asks.
