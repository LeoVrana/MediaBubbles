A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., has reportedly approved the first charges in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. CNN reported Friday that the charges are sealed under a federal judge’s order, with sources telling the network that those charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday. It is unclear what the charges are, the network reported. A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment to CNN. Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May to oversee the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. –– This breaking news story will be updated
