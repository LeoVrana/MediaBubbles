Rep Adam Schiff Adam (D-Calif.) on Tuesday told The Associated Press that Russia and some of President Trump’s policies are a threat to American democracy. While Russia poses an external threat, “in many respects, the challenge from within is more serious because we have a president who takes issue with the First Amendment and a president who describes the press as the enemy of the people,” Schiff said. He also cited Trump’s criticism of judges who rule against him and his efforts to limit immigration from Muslim-majority countries as threats to democracy, adding that Trump is attempting to undermine the ongoing probes into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Schiff criticized Republicans who have failed to stand up to Trump on those issues. “I think we’re all going to be held to account one day for what we did when our democracy is under threat,” Schiff said.
