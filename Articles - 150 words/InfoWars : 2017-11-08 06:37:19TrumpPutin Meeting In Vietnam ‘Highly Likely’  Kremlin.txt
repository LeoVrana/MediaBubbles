There is a strong possibility that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will meet on the sidelines of the upcoming international summit in Vietnam, the Kremlin said. The two presidents will be joining other world leaders taking part in the 25th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to be held on November 10-11. The Russian and US leaders’ respective offices are engaged in organizing bilateral talks during the two-day event, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. “Both Putin and Trump have extensive plans for bilateral meetings, which have been agreed upon long beforehand. There is also the APEC summit program, so the relevant offices are trying to choose an appropriate timing and format,” he said, adding that the likeliness of a Trump-Putin meeting was high. Last week, Trump said a meeting with Putin in Vietnam may happen. “Putin is very important because they [Russia] can help us with North Korea.
