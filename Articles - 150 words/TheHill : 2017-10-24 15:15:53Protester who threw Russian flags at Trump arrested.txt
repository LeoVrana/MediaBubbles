The protester who threw Russian flags at President Trump in the Capitol on Tuesday has been arrested. A statement from Capitol Police identifies the protester as 36-year-old Ryan Clayton of Sterling, Va., and says that he has been preliminarily charged with unlawful conduct. Police arrested Clayton after they say he threw Russian flags at Trump as the president entered a lunch with GOP senators. He could be heard shouting "Trump is treason." The incident is under investigation, according to police. Clayton identified himself as a member of “Americans Take Action." He is reportedly the same man who asked Jared Kushner to sign a Russian flag, and who got attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference to wave Russian flags during Trump’s speech, according to ABC News. The protest came amid multiple investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has previously called the Russia probe a "witch hunt."
