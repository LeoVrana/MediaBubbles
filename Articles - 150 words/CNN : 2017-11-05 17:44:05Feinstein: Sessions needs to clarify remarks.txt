Washington (CNN) California Sen Dianne Feinstein said Sunday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should come before the Senate again to clear up his statements about Russia and the Trump campaign. Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, said on CNN's "State of the Union" that she would discuss bringing Sessions before her panel with the committee's Republican chairman, Iowa Sen Chuck Grassley. "I think he should come back and clarify it," Feinstein said of Sessions. Last Monday, unsealed court records showed former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government -- the campaign's clearest connection so far to Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. According to the court documents, Papadopoulos suggested at a campaign meeting that then-candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet. A photo showed Sessions also attended
