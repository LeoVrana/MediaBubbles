Former US Attorney Preet Bharara on Tuesday said President Trump should be impeached if he fires Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Bharara, who was fired by Trump earlier this year, has been active on Twitter in responding to the first charges in Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference, which were unsealed Monday. Earlier Tuesday, Bharara encouraged Trump to “keep up the tweeting” after the president took to Twitter to downplay Paul Manafort’s indictment and George Papadopoulos’ guilty plea. Bharara previously said he believes Mueller will look to see how Trump reacts to any news about the investigation, and possibly use it as evidence moving forward. On Monday, Bharara predicted there will be more charges in Mueller’s investigation.
