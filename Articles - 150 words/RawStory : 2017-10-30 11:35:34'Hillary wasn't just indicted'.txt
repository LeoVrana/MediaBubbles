Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain (Photo: Screen capture) A fight broke out between the women on “The View” Monday after the news broke that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts, including “conspiracy against the United States.” Republican and former Fox News contributor Meghan McCain claimed that this is all an “ultimate breakdown of democracy,” and that “both sides” were to blame for the allegedly illegal actions by President Donald Trump’s campaign staff. Former prosecutor Sunny Hostin went off. “Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let’s not talk about ‘both sides,'” Hostin said. “Can I please finish!” McCain cut in. “No, no, no, let’s not talk about ‘both sides,'” Hostin repeated. “Hillary Clinton and the dossier –” McCain said, talking over her. “Hillary Clinton is not the president and Hillary Clinton wasn’t just indicted!” Hostin shouted, and the audience went nuts. Even Sara Haines began the segment joking
