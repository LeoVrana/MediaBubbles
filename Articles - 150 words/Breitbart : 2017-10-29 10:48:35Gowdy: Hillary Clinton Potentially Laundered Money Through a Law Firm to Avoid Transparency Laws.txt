On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” House Oversight Committee chairman Rep Trey Gowdy (R-SC) discussed the opposition research conducted on President Donald Trump in the so-called Russian dossier. Gowdy said he was interested in looking into if the Hillary Clinton campaign attempted to “launder all of this through a law firm” to avoid transparency laws. Gowdy said, “I’m not an election law expert, but the good news is you don’t have to be too understated the absurdity believing you can just launder all of your campaign money by just hiring a law firm. Imagine if you and I were running for Congress, and we just hired a law firm and said ‘Hey, you go to all the opposition, you go buy all the television, you go buy all the bumper stickers, you go higher all the experts, and we will launder all of this through a law firm.
