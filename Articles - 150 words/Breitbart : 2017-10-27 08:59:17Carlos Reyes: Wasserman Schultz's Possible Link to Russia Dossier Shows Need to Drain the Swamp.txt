A GOP challenger to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz wants the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairwoman “to come clean on her knowledge of payments” for the so-called Russia dossier. “When you talk about draining the swamp, it starts with DWS,” Carlos Reyes, a congressional candidate for Florida’s District 23, tells Breitbart News. In a press statement, Reyes says the report that the DNC, under Wasserman Schultz’s leadership, funded the Russia dossier “raises important questions.” “What did Debbie Wasserman Schultz know when she approved the payment of $3.6 million dollars to Marc E. Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm for the Kremlin assisted research project?” the Miami-born, Cuban American asks. Wasserman Shultz has, however, denied knowing about the arrangement by both the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign to fund the opposition research that led to an FBI investigation into possible collusion between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government.
