# MediaBubbles
This folder contains the files from my thesis "In Search of the Media Bubbles: Using Topic Modeling and Knowledge Representation Methods to Evaluate News Media Coverage."

Folders contain files relevant to data collection, the data collected, and files related to the topic model and network text analyses. The code has not been updated to remove file paths. 

Gephi files for the network text analyses can be found in the Analyses folder.
